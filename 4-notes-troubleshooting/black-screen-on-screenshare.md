# Black screen on screenshare

Discord (or a similar app with streaming capability) showing only a black screen when trying to stream the whole desktop? Don't worry, your system is working correctly.

Apps that do this are either very old or aren't properly mantained, and thus were never updated to work with PipeWire and Wayland.

I suggest you either open the browser version of such programs when you need to stream, or just install alternative clients that are properly maintained (e.g. [Vesktop](https://flathub.org/apps/dev.vencord.Vesktop) for Discord).
