# Deimonn's Void Guides

This documentation holds various guides to doing stuff in [Void Linux](https://www.voidlinux.org). I originally wrote these as install notes, then rewrote them to be agnostic - and then they started growing a lot.

Some guides may be useful outside of Void, too.

If you don't have an installation yet, you can start with the [installation guide](1-installation/guide.md).
